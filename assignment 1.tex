The effects of stress can be either positive or negative. What isperceived as positive stress by one person may be perceived as negative stress byanother, since everyone perceives situations differently. According to Barden (2001),negative stress is becoming a major illness in the work environment, and it candebilitate employees and be costly to employers. Managers need to identify thosesuffering from negative stress and implement programs as a defense against stress.These programs may reduce the impact stress has on employees' work performance.\section{Statement of the problem}The purpose of this study was to determine the negative effects of stress on employeesand the methods employers use to manage employees' stress.\section{Significance of the Study}There are three primary groups that may benefit from this study. The first group,consisting of employees in today's business organizations, may learn to identify waysthat stress negatively affects their work performance. Identifying the negative effectsmay enable them to take necessary action to cope with stress. By sharing thisknowledge, employees can act as a vehicle to help management implement appropriatestress reduction programs. The second group that may benefit from this study isemployers who may gain insight as to how stress is actually negatively affectingemployeesâ€™ work performance. Finally, educators can use these findings as a valuableguide to incorporate into their curriculum. By emphasizing to students the importanceof developing programs to deal with stress, the students may be able to transfer thisknowledge to the workplace, thereby improving the quality of the work environment.\section{Scope of the study}This study was limited to the perceptions of full-time business employees as to thenegative effects that stress has on work performance and the steps that employers aretaking to manage stress. For the purpose of this study, what constitutes full-timeemployment is defined by the employer. This study was restricted to businessesoperating in the Central Texas area. The Central Texas area encompasses allcommunities within Hays, Kendall, Travis, and Williamson counties. For the purposeof this study, stress is defined as disruptive or disquieting influences that negativelyaffect an individual in the workplace. Data for this study were collected during the fallof 2002.\section{Review of Related Literature}Barden (2001), a freelance writer specializing in health care and a former managingeditor of Commerce and Health, stated the importance of wellness programs and gavespecific examples of corporations that are successfully implementing suchprograms. The Morrison Company currently saves $8.33 for every dollar spent onwellness by offering programs such as weight loss, exercise, and back care. AxonPetroleum estimates that wellness programs will save $1.6 million each year in healthcare costs for its 650 employees. In addition to Morrison and Axon Petroleum, Bardencited the savings for six other companies. According to the Wellness Bureau ofAmerica, the success of these companies offers concrete proof that wellness programspay off by lowering health care costs, reducing absenteeism, and increasingproductivity.Foster (2002), a professional speaker on stress-management, surveyed midlevelmanagers and found stress to be a major determinant in worker productivity.According to the study, the primary areas affected by stress are employee morale,absenteeism, and decision making abilities. By recognizing that a problem exists andby addressing the issue, managers can reduce stressful activities and increase workerperformance in the business organization.Harrold and Wayland (2002) reported that increasing stress affects morale,productivity, organizational efficiency, absenteeism, and profitability for bothindividuals and the organization. The problem for businesses today is knowing howto determine stressful areas in their organizations and how to use constructive confrontationmethods to reduce stress and improve efficiency. According to the authors,organizations that make a positive effort to deal with stress not only help build trustamong their employees, but also increase the productivity of their employees and theorganization as a whole.Maurer (2002) stated that stress-induced illnesses are prevalent in theworkplace today, and stress is the problem of the sufferer and the employer. Stresscauses absenteeism and can lead to other problems such as drug addiction, alcoholism,depression, and poor job performance. According to Maurer, the annual BarlowCorporation Forum on Human Resource Issues and Trends reported that large numbersof companies noticed severe levels of stress exhibited by employees. The forum'spanelists agreed that more needed to be done in the workplace to help employeesmanage stress. Some of the suggestions were to expand wellness programs, offerstress-management seminars, and teach staff how to balance work and family life.Maurer also noted that Olympic TeamTech, a computer management company, hasdealt with employee stress by providing training programs, monitoring employeeconcerns, and meeting once a month to be proactive instead of reactive. OlympicTeamTech's turnover is less than the industry average.Schorr (2001), a stress-management consultant, stated that stress causesproblems in the workplace which negatively affect employee health and organizationalproductivity. Stress can lead to problems such as job dissatisfaction, alcoholism,absenteeism, physical ailments, and poor job performance. If managers know how toprevent and cope with stress, productivity can be increased. Many companiesinstituted stress-management programs that led to a decline in absenteeism, a decreasein sickness and accident costs, and/or an increase in job performance. Schorr reportedthat a stress inventory, available from a stress-management program, can assistexecutives and managers in assessing employee stress. The inventory can identify thesources of stress, which may include physical elements as well as other factors. Oncethese sources have been assessed, the program can provide the necessary skills forcoping with the problems, and participants can learn that there are alternative ways ofreacting to stress.\section{Methods of the Study}\subsection{Source of Data}Data for this study were collected using a questionnaire developed by a group ofstudents at Southwest Texas State University. The questionnaire was divided intothree parts. Part one consisted of a list of 15 work performance areas that may benegatively affected by a person's level of stress. Respondents were asked to indicatewhether stress increased, decreased, or had not changed their work performance ineach area. They were also asked to indicate from the list of 15 work performance areasthe area that was the most negatively affected by stress and the area that was the leastnegatively affected by stress. In the second part of the questionnaire, a list of 17programs was provided and the respondents were asked to indicate which programstheir companies had implemented to manage stress. Part three was designed to collectdemographic data for a respondent profile, including full-time employee classificationand age group.\subsection{Sample Selection}The respondents involved in this survey were employees working in companieslocated in Central Texas. A non probability, convenience sampling technique was usedto collect primary data. Each member of the research team was responsible fordistributing three questionnaires to members of the sample. To ensure confidentiality,respondents were given self-addressed, stamped envelopes in which to return theircompleted questionnaires to Southwest Texas State University. Controls were used toeliminate duplication of the responses.\subsection{Statistical Methods}Simple statistical techniques were used to tabulate the results of this study. Theprimary data were analyzed using a percent of response. To compute the percent ofresponse, the number of responses to each choice was divided by the total number ofrespondents who answered the question. In question one, the percents of responses forthe negative effects of stress on the 15 work performance areas were reported. Theresults of the next two questions were tabulated by totaling the number of respondentswho chose an area they believed was least or most affected by stress. The fourthquestion reported the percent of respondents whose employers offered the listedprograms to manage stress. Questions five and six asked the respondents to indicate ifthey were considered full-time employees and to indicate their age group.\section{Limitations Of The Study}This study may be limited through the use of a questionnaire as a data collectioninstrument. Because questionnaires must generally be brief, areas that may have beenaffected by stress may not have been included in the questionnaire.Also, all programs that may be available to employees for managing stress maynot have been included in the study. The study may also be limited by the use of anonprobability, convenience sampling method. The sample of business employees forthe study was chosen for convenience and may not be representative of the totalpopulation of business employees. Care should be taken when generalizing thesefindings to the entire population. Finally, the use of simple statistical techniques mayintroduce an element of subjectivity into the interpretation and analysis of the data. Allattempts have been made to minimize the effects of these limitations on the study.\end{document}
